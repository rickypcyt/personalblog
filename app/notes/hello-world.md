# Hello, World!

This is a simple markdown note. You can use it to jot down your thoughts, ideas, or anything else you'd like to remember.

## Features

- **Markdown Support**: Format your text with headers, lists, and more
- `Code Blocks`: Share code snippets with syntax highlighting
- [Links](https://example.com): Add references to other resources

## Getting Started

1. Create a new `.md` file in the `app/notes` directory
2. Start writing your content using markdown
3. Save the file and it will be automatically processed

## Example Code

```javascript
// This is a code block
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

greet('Reader'); // Output: Hello, Reader!
```
